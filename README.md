# HERE BE DRAGONS

This repo is a bunch of magic that generates a CLI from protocol buffer
definitions. This is out of laziness and not wanting to have to maintain
a big client with a lot of duplicated code just to interact with a server.

Some say it's clever. Some say it's a mess. I don't care as long as it's fast
and low-maintenance.
